# Challenge 02 - Professional Portfolio Beginnings


## Description


This web application is designed to highlight myself, my work experiences, and the projects and assignments that I will be accomplishing in this class. With this being accessible via online connection, future employers might use this as reference when I apply to work for them or for me to revisit past projects. Due to just starting out in this Bootcamp, the nature of this specific web application is currently incomplete and will be added to as I progress in this program. This will result in projects being added to the Project section of the web application as well as refinements in the appearance and user interactions.
